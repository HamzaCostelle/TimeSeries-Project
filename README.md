# TimeSeries-Project
DSTools1 Final project on Time Series using PRSA air quality dataset from UCI repository

This project uses the recorded PM2.5 concentration data in Beijing from 2010 to 2015. The concentration of an air pollutant (eg. ozone) is given in micrograms (one-millionth of a gram) per cubic meter air or µg/m3. For a point of reference, 5 is considered safe by the US Environmental Protection Agency's national ambient air quality standards so long as a person breathes in an average of 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air (μg/m3) or less per day over the duration of a year.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to construct a time series forecast that can predict daily PM2.5 concentration and minimize exposure to days on which high PM2.5 concentration levels is likely. Short of an accurate forecast, data cleaning, feature engineering and exploratory data analysis- including relevant visualizations- will be conducted to better understand any trends available from this initial step.
